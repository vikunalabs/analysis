**Question**: I'm working on user registration process both via traditional registration form and via google. From DB perspective, I'm planning to create the below tables.

user_profiles (for business related user data)
user_accounts (for auth related attributes)
federated_identities

I've a question - My registration form captures inputs such as username, email, password, organization, terms consent, marketing notification. So should I create user account first and then user profile via async event? or the other way?

For the social login i.e., google, its create that I will check for federated if first in the federated table and then create an entry in user account table, if no federated if exist.

**Answer**: Excellent question! This is a classic architectural decision for modern applications. Your table structure is very sound.

The short answer is: **You should create the `user_accounts` record first, and then the `user_profiles` record, ideally within the same database transaction.**

Let's break down the "why" and then discuss the async event part.

### The Recommended Flow: Transactional Creation

For your traditional registration form, the process should look like this:

1.  ​**Start a Database Transaction.** This is the most critical step.
2.  ​**Insert into `user_accounts`.** This creates the core authentication identity. You'll store the username, email (hashed) password, and timestamps here. The `email` acts as a key link between the two tables.
3.  ​**Insert into `user_profiles`.** Using the newly generated `user_id` from the `user_accounts` table, you now create the profile record. You'll store the `organization`, `terms_consent`, `marketing_notification`, and any other business data here.
4.  ​**Commit the Transaction.**

**Why this order and why a transaction?**

*   **Data Integrity:** The `user_profiles` table has a foreign key (`user_id`) that references the `user_accounts` table. The `user_accounts` record *must* exist first for this constraint to be satisfied. A transaction ensures that both inserts succeed or both fail. You never want a situation where a profile exists without an account, or vice-versa, as it would create an orphaned record and potential application errors.
*   **Atomicity:** User registration is a single business operation. "Creating a user" means creating both their authentication identity *and* their business profile. A transaction guarantees this atomicity.
*   **Simplicity:** It's straightforward and happens in a single, quick request/response cycle.

### Where Does the "Async Event" Come In?

You don't use an async event for the *core creation* of the `user_profiles` record. However, you **absolutely should use async events for any side effects** that are non-essential for the user to complete their registration.

**Synchronous (in the transaction):**
*   Create `user_accounts` record.
*   Create `user_profiles` record.
*   Send a welcome email? (No! See below)

**Asynchronous (via a message/event queue):**
*   **Sending Emails:** The welcome email, email verification link, etc. These can take hundreds of milliseconds to complete and should not block the user from getting a successful registration response. If the email service is down, it shouldn't prevent user signup. You would publish an event like `UserRegisteredEvent(user_id, email)` to a queue, and a separate worker would consume it and handle the email.
*   **Audit Logging:** Writing to a separate audit log system.
*   **Updating Search Indexes:** If you have a user search feature.
*   **Syncing to a Data Warehouse** (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake).
*   **Triggering Marketing Campaigns:** Adding the user to a mailing list in Mailchimp or Customer.io based on their `marketing_notification` preference.

So, the flow with async events would be:

1.  Start DB Transaction.
2.  Create `user_accounts`.
3.  Create `user_profiles`.
4.  Commit Transaction. **(The user sees "Success!" at this point)**
5.  Publish a `UserRegisteredEvent` with the user's details.
6.  Async workers listen for this event and handle all the non-critical tasks.

### Social Login (Google) Flow

Your plan for social login is correct. Here is the detailed flow:

1.  User clicks "Sign in with Google".
2.  Your backend receives an OAuth callback with the user's Google profile data (Google User ID, email, name, etc.).
3.  ​**Check the `federated_identities` table:** Search for a record with the `provider_name = 'google'` and `provider_subject_id` = (the unique ID from Google).
    *   **If found:** Retrieve the `user_id` linked to this identity. Fetch the `user_accounts` and `user_profiles` for this `user_id` and log the user in.
4.  ​**If not found:** This is a new user signing up via Google.
    *   Check if the user's email from Google already exists in the `user_accounts` table. This handles the case where someone registered with a password first and then tries to use Google.
        *   **If email exists:** You can link the new Google identity to the existing account by creating a record in `federated_identities` for this user. Then log them in.
        *   **If email does not exist:** This is a brand new user.
            *   **Start a Database Transaction.**
            *   **Create `user_accounts` record:** For social logins, you might leave the `password` field NULL. You can populate the `email` and `username` (perhaps from the email prefix or a generated one).
            *   **Create `user_profiles` record:** Use the name information from Google to pre-populate the `first_name` and `last_name` fields. You may set `terms_consent` to `true` and timestamp it, as they consented at the Google consent screen.
            *   **Create `federated_identities` record:** Insert a record linking the new `user_id` to the Google `provider_subject_id`.
            *   **Commit the Transaction.**
            *   Publish a `UserRegisteredEvent` (perhaps with a `registration_method: 'google'` property) for async jobs.

### Summary

| Operation | Primary DB Actions (Transactional) | Async Event For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Form Registration** | 1. Insert `user_accounts`<br>2. Insert `user_profiles` | Welcome Email, Analytics, etc. |
| **Google Sign-In (New User)** | 1. Insert `user_accounts`<br>2. Insert `user_profiles`<br>3. Insert `federated_identities` | Welcome Email, Analytics, etc. |
| **Google Sign-In (Existing User)** | None (only read operations) | - |

This approach ensures data integrity, a good user experience, and a scalable, maintainable architecture.
